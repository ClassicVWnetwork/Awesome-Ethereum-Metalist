### Awesome Homomorphic Encryption

Homomorphic encryption is a [cryptographic](https://brilliant.org/wiki/cryptography/) method that allows mathematical operations on data to be carried out on ciphertext, instead of on the actual data itself. The ciphertext is an encrypted version of the input data (also called plain text). It is operated on and then decrypted to obtain the desired output. The critical property of homomorphic encryption is that the same output should be obtained from decrypting the operated ciphertext as from simply operating on the initial plain text.[[source]](https://brilliant.org/wiki/homomorphic-encryption/)
